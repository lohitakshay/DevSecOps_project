# Automated DevSecOps Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains the code and configurations for an **Automated DevSecOps Pipeline**. The pipeline integrates continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) practices with built-in security checks, ensuring that code is tested, analyzed, and deployed securely.

## Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Security Scans:** Integrated security analysis tools such as SonarQube, Trivy, and OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities in code and container images.
- **Containerization:** Uses Docker to containerize the application.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Notifications:** Sends email notifications on pipeline status.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Jenkins:** Orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker:** Containerizes the application.
- **Kubernetes:** Manages containerized applications in a cluster.
- **SonarQube:** Analyzes code for quality and security.
- **Trivy:** Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP ZAP:** Performs security testing on web applications.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Jenkins:** Ensure Jenkins is installed and running.
- **Docker:** Install Docker to handle containerization.
- **Kubernetes:** Set up a Kubernetes cluster.
- **SonarQube:** Install and configure SonarQube.
- **Trivy:** Install Trivy for Docker image scanning.
- **OWASP ZAP:** Install OWASP ZAP for security testing.
