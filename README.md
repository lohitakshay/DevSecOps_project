# DevSecOps Project

## Overview
The **DevSecOps Project** repository is dedicated to demonstrating the integration of DevOps practices with robust security measures. This project automates the entire process of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) while embedding security checks at every stage of the pipeline. The aim is to ensure that code is not only efficiently developed and deployed but also thoroughly vetted for security vulnerabilities, thereby fostering a secure software development lifecycle.

## Features
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: The pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment phases, reducing manual intervention and accelerating the release process.
- **Integrated Security Scans**: Security tools like SonarQube, Trivy, and OWASP ZAP are embedded into the pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities in code and container images.
- **Containerization with Docker**: The application is containerized using Docker, making it portable and consistent across various environments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: The containerized application is deployed and managed on a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring scalability and high availability.
- **Notification System**: Email notifications are configured to keep stakeholders informed about the status of the pipeline, including success, failure, and security alerts.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Jenkins**: Acts as the orchestrator for the CI/CD pipeline, automating various stages such as code build, testing, and deployment.
- **Docker**: Facilitates containerization, enabling the application to run in isolated environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.
- **SonarQube**: Analyzes the source code for quality and security issues.
- **Trivy**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Conducts security testing on web applications to identify potential threats.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed and configured on your system before proceeding with the setup:
- **Jenkins**: [Install Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) and ensure it is running.
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to handle application containerization.
- **Kubernetes**: [Set up a Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) to manage containerized applications.
- **SonarQube**: [Install SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/) and configure it according to your project needs.
- **Trivy**: [Install Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.22.0/installation/) for scanning Docker images.
- **OWASP ZAP**: [Install OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) for web application security testing.

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lohitakshay/DevSecOps_project.git
   cd DevSecOps_project
   ```

2. **Jenkins Configuration:**
   - **Set up Jenkins Jobs:** Use the `jenkins_pipeline` file in the repository to configure your Jenkins jobs.
   - **Install Plugins:** Ensure all necessary plugins are installed in Jenkins, as listed in `plugins.txt`.

3. **Docker & Kubernetes Setup:**
   - **Build Docker Images:** Use the `devsec.dockerfile` to build Docker images.
     ```bash
     docker build -t your-image-name -f devsec.dockerfile .
     ```
   - **Deploy to Kubernetes:** Deploy the application using the Kubernetes configuration files (`devsec_kub.yaml`, `devsecops-app.yaml`).
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f devsec_kub.yaml
     kubectl apply -f devsecops-app.yaml
     ```

4. **Security Tools Configuration:**
   - **SonarQube:** Configure SonarQube as per your project requirements.
   - **Trivy:** Run Trivy scans on your Docker images before deployment.
     ```bash
     trivy image your-image-name
     ```
   - **OWASP ZAP:** Perform security tests using OWASP ZAP.

5. **Run the Pipeline:**
   - Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process.
   - Monitor the build, test, and deployment stages through Jenkins.

### Troubleshooting & Tips
- **Jenkins Errors:** If you encounter issues in Jenkins, check the console output for detailed logs. Common issues may involve missing plugins or misconfigured paths.
- **Docker Build Failures:** Ensure your Dockerfile syntax is correct and all necessary dependencies are available.
- **Kubernetes Deployment Issues:** Verify that your Kubernetes cluster is running and the configurations in the YAML files are correct.
